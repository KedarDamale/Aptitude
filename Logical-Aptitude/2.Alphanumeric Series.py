"""
An alphanumeric series is formed by combining both alphabets and numbers. Sometimes it also includes symbols such as @,&,#, etc. So we can say that the Alphanumeric series is the combination of alphabets, numbers, and symbols. This is an important topic that needs to be covered for the Logical Reasoning section of the Aptitude test asked in the competitive examinations.

Types of Alphanumeric Series
1. Letter-Number Alternating Series
Rule: Letters and numbers alternate in a fixed pattern.

Example:

A2, C4, E6, G8, ?

Letters: A (+2) → C (+2) → E (+2) → G (+2) → I

Numbers: 2 (+2) → 4 (+2) → 6 (+2) → 8 (+2) → 10

Answer: I10

2. Letter-Number Embedded Series
Rule: Numbers and letters are combined within a single term.

Example:

3D, 7G, 11J, 15M, ?

Numbers: 3 (+4) → 7 (+4) → 11 (+4) → 15 (+4) → 19

Letters: D (+3) → G (+3) → J (+3) → M (+3) → P

Answer: 19P

3. Position-Based Series (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26)
Rule: Letters are converted to their alphabetical positions.

Example:

2, 6, 12, 20, ?

Logic: 1×2=2, 2×3=6, 3×4=12, 4×5=20, 5×6=30

Answer: 30 (or E if letters are expected since E=5)

4. Mixed Operations (Letters + Numbers)
Rule: Combines arithmetic operations with letter shifts.

Example:

Z1, Y4, X9, W16, ?

Letters: Z (-1) → Y (-1) → X (-1) → W (-1) → V

Numbers: 1²=1, 2²=4, 3²=9, 4²=16, 5²=25

Answer: V25

5. Reverse Alphabet Series
Rule: Letters follow reverse alphabetical order (Z=1, Y=2, ..., A=26).

Example:

V2, R3, N4, J5, ?

Letters: V (-4) → R (-4) → N (-4) → J (-4) → F

Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5 → 6

Answer: F6

Tips & Tricks To Solve Alphanumeric Questions
To solve Alphanumeric Questions, follow the tips and tricks given below:

For missing series: When a series with a pattern is given, containing alphabets and numbers. The candidate is asked to find the missing number in the blank space. 
For Alphabet-Number-Symbol Series: A series with alphabets, numbers, and different types of symbols (like &, *, $, etc.) are given, and questions are formed on it. 
Alphabetic Series: This type of Series only contains the English alphabet set in a particular pattern. No numbers or symbols are used here. 
Numerical Series: This type of Series only contains numbers, arranged in a specific pattern. Questions based on this type are usually asked in the form of a rearrangement of numbers in ascending, descending, or any other order.
