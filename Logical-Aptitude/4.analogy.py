Analogy
Last Updated : 07 Jul, 2025
Analogy is a topic of Logical Reasoning where two things are compared and conclusions are drawn based on their similarities. Analogies are asked in various forms. These questions are also very important for the Verbal Ability section of competitive examinations like SSC, Banking, RBI, etc. 

Analogy refers to a logical relationship between two pairs of words, numbers, or objects where a similar pattern or connection exists. It tests the ability to identify parallel relationships and apply the same rule to a new pair.

Types of Analogies in Reasoning
1. Numerical Analogy
Numerical Analogy or Analogies questions based on numbers are often noticed in the logical reasoning section of examinations. Numerical analogies are a type of analogy in Reasoning in which two numerical pairs are presented with similar characteristics, and the candidate must then find the missing number that has a relationship to the “?” that is the same as the one between the first two numbers.

Example:

(4, 16) :: (6, ?)

Explanation:
 In this analogy, the relationship between the numbers 4 and 16 is that 16 is the square of 4 (i.e.,
4
2
=
16
4 
2
 =16).
 To find the missing number, we follow the same relationship for 6:
6
2
=
36
6 
2
 =36

So, the answer is 36.

2. Letter/Word Analogy
Letter or Word Analogies in Reasoning is an important topic to prepare for the examination. A pair of letters or words is presented in a certain likeness between them in this form of analogy reasoning. Candidates must determine the similarities between the first two words and select the word from the alternatives that has the same similarities to the “?” as the first two.

Example:

(AB, CD) :: (EF, ?)

Explanation:
 The relationship between "AB" and "CD" is that each letter in the pair moves forward by 2 positions in the alphabet: A → C (A + 2), B → D (B + 2).
 Now, we apply the same logic to "EF":

E → G (E + 2)
F → H (F + 2)
So, the answer is GH.

3. Image-Based Analogy
A pair of Images are given in a particular likeness between the images in this form of analogy reasoning. Another image with comparable characteristics is also given. Candidates must be able to find out the similarities between the first two images and then choose the accurate image for the “?” similarities as the first two.

Example: 

sd
Explanation:
 In this analogy, the first two images show geometric shapes (square and triangle) with a circle inside. So, the missing image should follow the pattern of a geometric shape (circle) with another shape (triangle) inside.
