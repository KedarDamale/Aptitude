"""
The Statement and Conclusion section is a part of logical and analytical reasoning, which is frequently asked in all competitive exams. Statement and conclusion questions are a set of statements followed by conclusions. The general idea to solve such questions is just to understand the theme of the statement and the context in which the conclusions are made. Candidates need to select the most suitable choice matching the question. Making unnecessary assumptions while solving the statement and conclusion questions is the prime mistake made by aspirants seeking to get selected.

Statement and Conclusion questions are all about the understanding of the statement and its connectivity with the conclusion. The statement is a collection of words needed to construct a meaningful sentence. The question having the statement can have one or two or more than two conclusions; therefore, this requires some tricks and logical thinking for the solution of the statement. 

Tips and Tricks to solve statement & Conclusion Questions
The first trick is there to look after the keywords/hidden words within the question which are known as qualifiers of the statement.
There are two qualifiers apart from keywords Definitely and probably based on true and false. Therefore in questions, we have to see what is the conclusion required within the set of questions.

Question 1:

Statement: Some dogs are very friendly and can be trained to help people.

Conclusion I: All dogs are friendly.

Conclusion II: Some dogs are capable of helping people.

Answer: Conclusion I is False, Conclusion II is True.
Explanation: 

Conclusion I overgeneralizes the statement, while Conclusion II is directly supported, as some dogs can be trained to help people.

Question 2:

Statement: All employees in a company are required to take a lunch break.

Conclusion I: No employees can work during lunch breaks.

Conclusion II: Every employee must take a lunch break.

Answer: Conclusion II is True, Conclusion I is False.
Explanation: 

Conclusion II is directly supported by the statement. However, Conclusion I is not supported because employees may work after or before their lunch breaks.

Question 3:

Statement: The factory reduced production hours, leading to fewer defective products.

Conclusion I: The reduction in production hours caused fewer defective products.

Conclusion II: Fewer defective products were a result of reduced production hours.

Answer: Both Conclusions are True.
Explanation: 

Both conclusions follow from the cause-effect relationship given in the statement: reduced hours led to fewer defects.

Question 4:

Statement: A new law was passed to increase penalties for speeding.

Conclusion I: The number of speeding incidents will decrease immediately.

Conclusion II: Speeding fines will be higher under the new law.

Answer: Conclusion I is False, Conclusion II is True.
Explanation: 

The statement only mentions that penalties will increase, but it doesn't guarantee that speeding incidents will immediately decrease. Conclusion II correctly follows from the statement.
