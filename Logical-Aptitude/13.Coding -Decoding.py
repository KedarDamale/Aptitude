Coding -decoding is one of the most common sections included in all competitive exams, which are basically designed for hiring processes and higher education. Many candidates find Coding-Decoding questions challenging to solve, and as a result, they avoid attempting these scoring questions and lose some easy and quick marks.

Coding-Decoding is a reasoning skill where letters, numbers, or symbols are transformed using a hidden rule or pattern. Your task is to crack the logic to encode or decode the given information.

Types of Coding-Decoding
There are the following types of Coding-Decoding

Letter-based Coding 
Number-based Coding
Symbolic-based Coding 
1. Letter Coding 
Letter Coding is a type in which the letters are replaced with other letters.

Sample: JUNE is coded as "HSLC", then what should be the code for JULY.

Explanation:

 To solve these kinds of problems, you have to remember that every alphabet has a specific number.
So, according to the question,

JUNE is coded as "HSLC"
J is coded as 10, U is coded as 21, N is coded as 14 and E is coded as 5
In the same way, "HSLC" is coded as
H is coded as 8, S is coded as 19, L is coded as 12 and C is coded as 3

If you observe both the given word, it is coded by decreasing 2 for each alphabet.
So, in the same way, to code "JULY", the same number should be decreased.
So you code "JULY" as:
J is coded as 10, U is coded as 21, L is coded as 12, Y is coded as 25
So, in the same way, it decreased each alphabet by 2
The final solution for JULY would be 8, 19, 10, 23

And you should code the word as "HSJW".

2. Number Coding
Sample: GEEKS” is coded as 35542, and GAME is coded as 3895, then what would be the code for  SKEEG.

Explanation:

So, here  The code of every letter is already specified in the question itself, so no need to use fixed codes of the letters.

Now, specify the number of each letter to solve the problem. If you observe the two words, some of the letters are repeated, so no need to write the repeated letters.

Now, code the letters.

G is coded as 3, E is coded as 5, K is coded as 4, S is coded as 2, A is coded as 8, and M is coded as 9

Using these codes, "SKEEG" is coded as 2,4,5,5,3. 

3. Symbol Coding
Sample: If

⋆
=
5
⋆=5
△
=
10
△=10
□
=
15
□=15
⋄
=
20
⋄=20
then what is the value of 
⋆
+
△
+
⋄
⋆+△+⋄

Explanation:

Substitute the values:

⋆
=
5
,
 
△
=
10
,
 
⋄
=
20
⋆=5, △=10, ⋄=20

So,

⋆
+
△
+
⋄
⋆+△+⋄ = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35

This decodes the expression 
⋆
+
△
+
⋄
⋆+△+⋄to 35.

Important Tricks to Solve Coding-Decoding
Remember the values of A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4, E-5,...............X-24, Y-25, Z-26.

So, finding the reverse value of any number simply subtract that no. from 27 

 Ex:- the reverse of A, i.e., 1 is  27-1 =26 so, our answer is Z, whose value is 26. 

This concept will be very helpful in solving problems of Coding-Decoding.
