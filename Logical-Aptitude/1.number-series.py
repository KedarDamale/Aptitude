Number Series

A number series is an ordered sequence of numbers arranged according to a specific mathematical rule or pattern. Each number in the series relates to the others through consistent operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, or more complex relationships.

Number Series is a widely asked topic in the Logical Reasoning section of competitive examinations. There are two main types of questions asked,

1. Missing Term Series: A sequence is given with one or more missing numbers, and you must find the correct number that fits the pattern.

2. Wrong Term Series: A complete sequence is given, but one number is incorrect, and you must identify the wrong term and sometimes correct it.
