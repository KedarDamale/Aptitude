Sure, here’s a detailed, technical explanation of **sentence formation** and its **rules**:

---

## Sentence Formation: Definition and Concept

A **sentence** is a group of words arranged in a specific order that conveys a complete thought or idea. It typically contains a **subject** and a **predicate**, and expresses a statement, question, command, or exclamation.

### Core Components of a Sentence:

* **Subject:** The doer or topic of the sentence (usually a noun or pronoun).
* **Predicate:** The part that tells something about the subject, typically containing a verb.

Example:
*The cat (subject) sleeps (predicate).*

---

## Sentence Structure Types

1. **Simple sentence:** Contains one independent clause (one subject + predicate).

   * *She runs fast.*

2. **Compound sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses joined by conjunctions (and, but, or).

   * *She runs fast, and he jumps high.*

3. **Complex sentence:** Contains one independent clause and one or more dependent (subordinate) clauses.

   * *She runs fast because she trains daily.*

4. **Compound-complex sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.

   * *She runs fast because she trains daily, and he swims well.*

## Rules of Sentence Formation

### 1. Subject-Verb Agreement

The subject and verb must agree in **number** and **person**.

* Singular subject → Singular verb
* Plural subject → Plural verb

Examples:

* *He runs.* (singular)
* *They run.* (plural)

### 2. Correct Word Order

The typical word order in English sentences is:

**Subject + Verb + Object (SVO)**

Example:

* *She (S) eats (V) an apple (O).*

Exceptions exist (questions, commands, passive voice), but this is the default pattern.

### 3. Use of Articles and Determiners

Before singular countable nouns, appropriate articles (**a, an, the**) or determiners must be used.

Examples:

* *A dog* (indefinite)
* *The dog* (definite)

### 4. Proper Use of Tenses

The verb tense should match the time frame of the action or state (past, present, future).

Examples:

* Present simple: *He walks.*
* Past simple: *He walked.*
* Future simple: *He will walk.*

### 5. Use of Correct Punctuation

Every sentence should start with a capital letter and end with a punctuation mark appropriate to the sentence type:

* Period (.) for statements
* Question mark (?) for questions
* Exclamation mark (!) for exclamations

### 6. Avoid Sentence Fragments

A sentence must express a complete thought and have at least one independent clause.

**Fragment (incorrect):** *Because she runs fast.* (dependent clause alone)
**Correct:** *She won because she runs fast.*

### 7. Proper Use of Conjunctions

Conjunctions (and, but, or, because, although) are used to connect clauses and ideas logically.

Example:

* *She likes tea, but he prefers coffee.*

### 8. Modifier Placement

Modifiers (adjectives, adverbs) should be placed close to the word they modify to avoid ambiguity.

Example:

* Correct: *She quickly ran.*
* Incorrect: *She ran quickly the race.*

Sentence completion

Here are some strategies for sentence completion:

Read the Sentence: Analyze the sentence carefully, looking for clues in its structure and vocabulary. This helps determine the most suitable option even if the exact word is unfamiliar.
Hints: Look for contextual hints in the sentence that guide the correct word. Verify your choice by inserting it into the sentence.
Positive/Negative Significance: Identify whether the clues suggest a positive or negative word, helping to determine synonyms or antonyms.
Structure Words: Pay attention to words like but, however, although, and consequently, which clarify sentence relationships and the role of the missing word.
Visualize: Think about possible words before choosing, helping you avoid poor decisions and narrow down options.
Elimination: Rule out incorrect options based on their fit with the sentence. If unsure, move on and reconsider the choice later.
Working Backwards: In two-blank questions, eliminate incorrect options first. Working backwards often simplifies the decision process.


Tips and Tricks
1. Sentence Completion:

Requires vocabulary and logical reasoning.
If unfamiliar with a word, eliminate known wrong options first, then guess.
Focus on context and reasoning rather than just vocabulary.
2. Paragraph Completion:

Read the entire paragraph to grasp the main idea.
Choose the sentence that fits logically, maintains coherence, and follows grammar rules (tense, structure, vocabulary).
Verify by rereading the paragraph to ensure flow and correctness.
Key Approach: Prioritize context, logic, and grammar over rote vocabulary.

B

C

Ordering Of Sentences(paragraph formation)

Tips and Tricks to Solve Sentence Ordering Questions
1. Read all the sentences very carefully and then try to identify theme of the paragraph.

2. Identify all the keywords used and then try to link them with each other.

3. Check for grammatical errors and remove them while connecting the sentences into a meaningful paragraph.
