Steps to select the right words:

Read the entire sentence: Start by reading the entire sentence or statement carefully. Understanding the context is crucial for selecting the right word.
Identify Keywords: Look for keywords or phrases within the sentence that can give you clues about the missing word. Pay attention to any hints in the surrounding text.
Consider the meaning: Think about the overall meaning or message of the sentence. What word would make the sentence logically and grammatically correct?
Check for word type: Consider the part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) that the missing word should be. Is it an action word, a description, or a thing? This can help narrow down your choices.
Eliminate Inappropriate Options: If there are multiple choices, eliminate words that clearly do not fit the context. This can make your decision easier.
