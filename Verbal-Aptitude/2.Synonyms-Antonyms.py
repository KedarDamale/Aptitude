"""
Synonyms are words or expressions that have the same or nearly the same meaning in at least one context.

Synonymy is a semantic relation between lexical items.

Words that are synonyms share a similar denotation (literal meaning), but can differ in connotation, usage, register, or intensity.

Synonymy is context-dependent: two words may be synonymous in one context but not in another. For example, 
“big” and “large” are synonyms when referring to size, but “big” can mean “important” or “significant” 
while “large” usually does not.


Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings.

Antonymy is a semantic relationship where two lexical items express contrasting concepts.
There are different types of antonyms, which depend on the nature of opposition.
