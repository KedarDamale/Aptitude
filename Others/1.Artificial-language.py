"""
Artificial languages, in logical reasoning, 
are designed languages used for different 
purposes. Unlike natural languages that develop
naturally, artificial languages are intentionally 
created with specific rules and structures. 


Example 1: Artificial Language Translation:

gorblflur means fan belt

pixngorbl means ceiling fan

arthtusl means tile roof

Which word could mean "ceiling tile"?

A) gorbltusl
B) flurgorbl
C) arthflur
D) pixnarth
Answer: A) gorbltusl

Explanation: In the given artificial language, "pixngorbl" means "ceiling fan," and "arthtusl" means "tile roof." To represent "ceiling tile," we can combine the words for "ceiling" and "tile," which would be "pixn" and "arth" respectively. Therefore, "gorbltusl" is the correct choice.
