Judgement questions are part of the Logical Reasoning section in most of the competitive examinations. Judgement questions are solved by combining the knowledge given in the question and through common sense. Judgement questions must be prepared comprehensively as this is a scoring section in the reasoning section. As Judgement questions are one of the most asked questions in competitive examinations like RRB NTPC, SSC CGL exam, etc. so it is highly advisable to attempt judgement practice questions.
In the Judgements section, a fictitious scenario is presented and the task is to take reasonable and logical steps or judgements that suit the condition of the events. Here in this section, we shall see some examples and get acquainted with the concepts of Judgements.

Judgement in Reasoning
Judgement is the analysis, which is drawn after reading the statement and by using your common sense. The statement given is a combination of meaningful sentences. This is the only set of knowledge which you must use while answering the question. 

For example:
If Apples are ripe for a pie or pickle, what would you answer? Obviously, the answer would be sweet apples are best for pies not pickles. As a result, the decision or judgement is that apples are suitable for a pie.

Types of Judgement in Reasoning :  
1) Making Decision Based on Passages
In this type of judgement-based question, students are given a paragraph or passage of events, followed by a series of questions.

For Example :

Sachin is planning a birthday party on 26/07/2022. He wants to celebrate this memorable evening, but his friend is a very shy man who would rather spend the evening at home doing some chores and playing indoor games and he is also a food and drink lover. Sachin has chosen a restaurant that serves the best dishes in the city then which restaurant should Sachin choose so that his friend comes to the party with him? 

(1) Babian restaurant as it serves the best cuisine in the city.

(2) Chandrakala as it serves his friend's favorite dosa which is the best and cheap as compared to others.

(3) Bikanervala as it serves the best chaat and coffee as compared to others.

(4) Royal sky as it also serves non-veg and alcohol along with a pool corner for entertainment.

Clearly, he should choose the fourth restaurant as his friend will enjoy the food and drinks along with the pool corner game since his friend likes to play indoor games so his mind will be refreshed. 

2) Eligibility Based Judgements :
This includes the admission of students within the colleges based on merit. Some of the exams like B.ed entrance, PSUs, and banks have eligibility criteria.

You must be familiar with the key strategies if you want to correctly respond to the judgement reasoning questions. They deal with information that has been heard, seen, or read but is open to investigation or verification. Dates, events, natural occurrences, and other assertions are examples of facts. Based on what is known, conclusions are drawn about the unknown. Your ability to read between the lines is put to the test through inferences. Facts are the known information in the statement from which an inference was drawn. Therefore, all inferences are supported by evidence and logical reasoning.

For example:

All the intermediate students scoring above 70% are eligible for university admissions, and those below 70% have to give entrance and interview also.

Here, the filter technique of judgement will take place and the cutoff will be decided.
