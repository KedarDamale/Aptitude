Explanation:

Sarah can arrange the pens in 3! (3 factorial) ways because there are three pens.

3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways

So, the correct answer is (a): 6 ways.

2. In a game of chess, which piece can move diagonally and capture opponents?
a. Bishop

b. Knight

c. Rook

d. Queen

e. King

3. If a rectangle has a length of 8 units and a width of 4 units, what is its perimeter?
a. 12 units

b. 16 units

c. 24 units

d. 32 units

e. 64 units

Answer: c. 24 units

Explanation:

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times the sum of its length and width.

Perimeter = 2 x (8 units + 4 units) = 2 x 12 units = 24 units

So, the correct answer is (c): 24 units.

4. If you flip a fair coin twice, what is the probability of getting heads on both flips?
a. 1/4

b. 1/2

c. 3/4

d. 1/3

e. 2/3

Answer: a. 1/4

Explanation:

When flipping a fair coin twice, the probability of getting heads on each flip is 1/2.

To find the probability of both events happening, you multiply their individual probabilities.

Probability of heads on the first flip: 1/2

Probability of heads on the second flip: 1/2

Probability of both flips being heads: (1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4

So, the correct answer is (a): 1/4.

5. If a train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 mph and returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 40 mph, what is the average speed for the entire round trip?
a. 50 mph

b. 48 mph

c. 45 mph

d. 52 mph

e. 55 mph

Answer: a. 48 mph

Explanation:

To find the average speed for the entire round trip, you can use the formula:

Average Speed = (2 * Speed1 * Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2).  We can get this formula from the simple formula of total-distance / total-time 

Average Speed = (2 * 60 mph * 40 mph) / (60 mph + 40 mph) = (4800 mph^2) / (100 mph) = 48 mph

So, the correct answer is (a): 48 mph.

6. In a deck of playing cards, what is the total number of cards with hearts as their suit?
a. 13 cards

b. 26 cards

c. 39 cards

d. 52 cards

e. 4 cards

Answer: a. 13 cards

Explanation:

In a standard deck of playing cards, there are 13 cards in each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades).

So, the total number of cards with hearts as their suit is 13 cards.

So, the correct answer is (a): 13 cards.

7. If a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours, what is its average speed in miles per hour (mph)?
a. 40 mph

b. 60 mph

c. 80 mph

d. 100 mph

e. 120 mph

Answer: b. 60 mph

Explanation:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Average Speed = 120 miles / 2 hours = 60 mph

So, the correct answer is (b): 60 mph.

8. If you have a pizza divided into 8 equal slices, and you eat 3 slices, how many slices are left?
a. 1 slice
